Trivia Clash

A Jeopardy-style trivia game built with JavaScript, jQuery, and Axios.

About the Project

Trivia Clash is my spin on a classic trivia/Jeopardy-style game. I built it to practice working with APIs, timers, and multi-player game logic, while also making something fun to play with friends.

The game fetches trivia categories and questions from an API, builds a dynamic board, and lets multiple players compete by answering timed questions. It includes hints and scoring to keep things competitive.

Features

Dynamic board generation – categories and clues are fetched live from an API

Timers and difficulty modes – Easy, Medium, and Hard adjust how much time you get per question

Multi-player support – Play solo or against friends (2+ players)

Hints – Each player can reveal a helpful hint (but only once per game)

Stats tracking – Real-time scoring with correct/incorrect counts

Replay anytime – Restart the game with new categories in one click
